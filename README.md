# Assignment
In general, the idea is using commitment schemes.  

You can generate random r and mix it with your card, publish the hash function </br> which would be published. pub <- hash(r, card). 

Other idea would be using Pedersen commitment schmeme based on discrete logarithm.  

Note to myself: Add more documentation once you finish. Maybe reference to my current work of Homomorphic Schulze Method, and verification of Sigma protocols.
